# Boxer

This Git repository contains a copy of the C&C parser and Boxer, from
the now-unavailable Subversion repository, for use with USC's natural
language interpretation pipelines:
- [Interpret](https://github.com/jgordon/interpret)
- [Metaphor ADP](https://github.com/isi-metaphor/Metaphor-ADP)

Notably, these expect a version of Boxer that does not produce semantic
roles, so it does not work with Christoph Rzymski's
[repository](https://github.com/chrzyki/candc)
