American Cyanamid Co. , offering of 1,250,000 common shares , via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets .

4
Limited Inc. , offering of up to $ 300 million of debt securities and warrants .

But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .

6
Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky .

7
Giveaways just give people the wrong image , said Mr. Heinemann .

8
Still , Time 's move is being received well , once again .

When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing .

10
Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm .

11
You ca n't live on that .

12
But that wo n't be easy .

13
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .

14
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called Daybreak , Daywatch , Newsday , and Newsnight , but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .

15
Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming .

16
Some in the industry are skeptical .

17
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage .

18
But the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts .

19
And the facts , as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits , were different .

20
The transaction , announced in August , included about $ 146 million in deposits at the five outlets in California 's San Joaquin Valley .

21
In the first six months of the year it posted a net loss of $ 33.1 million .

22
Though the argument may have a common-sense ring to it , even the S&L lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position .

We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system .

31
The group said it would consider , among other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a class-action lawsuit seeking court approval for the withholdings .

32
I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , he said .

33
Energy prices then plummeted through the summer , causing the index to decline for three consecutive months .

34
Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said .

35
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % .

36
Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August .

37
CityFed 's president and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors .

38
All these actions , Mr. Atherton said , will result in a loss of $ 125 million to $ 150 million for the third quarter .

39
Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock .

40
He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision .

41
In the same month , the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track .

42
CenTrust , which is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation .

43
Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties .

44
The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate .

45
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .

46
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million .

A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian .

European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that .

For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason .

50
There is , for instance , One Man and His Dog , a herding contest among sheep dogs .

51
It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series .

52
Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are .

53
When the dollar is in a free-fall , even central banks ca n't stop it .

54
But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .

55
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .

56
Bids must be received by 1 p.m. EDT Thursday at the Treasury or at Federal Reserve banks or branches .

57
Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals , including Matra S.A. in France and Britain 's General Electric Co. PLC .

58
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans .

59
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .

60
That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .

The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day .

62
The Boston firm said stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago .

Predicting the financial results of computer firms has been a tough job lately .

64
Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .

65
This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations .

66
While the earnings picture confuses , observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer .

67
Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally .

68
On the other hand , the battle of the bus is expected to grow increasingly irrelevant .

69
Users do n't care about the bus , said Daniel Benton , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co. .

70
He said Apple 's family of Macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses and no one seems to mind .

71
The gap between winners and laggards will grow .

72
Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms .

73
But they will have to act quickly .

The gains , to be sure , are rather small .

77
THANKS TO modern medicine , more couples are growing old together .

78
That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 .

79
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children .

80
The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40 % from 32 % .

81
Across the board , these consumers value quality , buy what they like rather than just what they need , and appreciate products that are distinctive .

82
Thirty-five percent attend religious services regularly ; at the same time , 60 % feel that in life one sometimes has to compromise one 's principles .

83
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 .

84
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... .

85
There are 13.1 million students in college this fall , up 2 % from 1988 , the National Center for Education Statistics estimates .

86
This small Dallas suburb 's got trouble .

Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool .

And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights .

89
At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes .

I thought this was all taken care of in The Music Man .

91
For instance : Haole -LRB- white -RRB- is not the ultimate insult ; Mainland haole is .

92
And the local expression for brother is brah , not bruddah .

93
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism .

94
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is like a dinosaur .

95
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck .

96
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .

97
The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a 60-year history of calm , right up through Friday .

The economy , he added , remains well-balanced and the outlook is for continued moderate growth .

After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover said : The fundamental business of the country ... is on a sound and prosperous basis .

100
Charles J. Lawson Jr. , 68 , who had been acting chief executive since June 14 , will continue as chairman .

101
In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision .

102
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress .

103
A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions .

104
These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .

105
It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken .

106
Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy .

107
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees .

108
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining .

109
Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday .

110
Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments .

111
Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective August 1990 .

112
Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding .

113
Reduction of Medicare spending in fiscal 1990 by some $ 2.8 billion , in part by curbing increases in reimbursements to physicians .

114
Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered .

115
I was laid off in August 1988 , and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in August 1989 .

116
Are you kidding !

117
New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years .

118
If they croak stocks like that , he said , it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about .

119
They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , said Franklin President Duane H. Hall .

120
I think it was a little premature on their part .

121
Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .

122
If you 're a technician , you obey the signals .

123
I see a possibility of going to 2200 this month .

Most people , he says , have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like .

Now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive .

126
She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of fair value .

127
Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal .

128
But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash .

129
I think the market will be heading down into November , he says .

130
Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .

131
Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year .

132
So it 's a very mixed bag .

133
I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , he says .

134
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable .

135
There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , he says .

136
Mario Gabelli .

137
He sees economic problems , financial problems ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession .

138
Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go .

139
T-bills probably are the right place to be , he says .

140
I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative .

141
He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .

142
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth .

143
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .

144
That certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by Mr. Lantos .

145
By any reasonable man criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .

146
Right now they 're pursuing evidence .

147
That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice .

148
He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials .

149
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .

150
In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines .

151
I do not by any means defend HUD management .

In academia , a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .

157
In the '70s , the market took falls nine times in a row on Friday the you-know-what .

158
It was like the Friday before Black Monday two years ago .

159
Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits .

160
Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading .

161
Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors .

162
Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through September , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. .

163
It was n't intentional , we were all busy .

164
On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to .

165
Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , he said .

166
I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey .

167
But they are worried .

168
This is not a major crash , she said .

169
Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer .

170
Nevertheless , Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders .

The turnover in both issues was roughly normal .

Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors .

Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens , N.Y. , company 's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes .

Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic .

But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said .

192
The West German retailer ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus AG plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed anti-takeover defense of companies in the Netherlands .

193
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue .

194
He termed ASKO 's legal actions as unproductive to international cooperation among European retailers .

195
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .

196
For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .

But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision .

We hope to take advantage of it , said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club .

214
There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders .

215
Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it .

216
I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , she says , that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it .

217
It 's so close to completion , Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , said a Southwest spokesman .

218
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand .

219
We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot , said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg .

220
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared .

221
Merrill Lynch ca n't survive without the little guy .

222
Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds .

223
Individual investors are still angry about program trading , Mr. Quackenbush says .

224
But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried .

Would Mr. Antori ever get back in ?

The crowded field for notebook-sized computers is about to become a lot more crowded .

228
Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .

229
One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name .

230
At 4 1/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .

231
Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .

232
Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises .

233
The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times .

234
Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .

235
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table .

236
The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them .

237
Grumman Corp. received an $ 18.1 million Navy contract to upgrade aircraft electronics .

238
Of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows .

239
Other new lows included Navistar International Corp. , Union Carbide Corp. and Bethlehem Steel Corp. , all of which are included in the industrial average .

240
Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , on margin -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop .

241
Margin calls since Friday have been higher than usual , but reasonable , a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said .

242
He said Schwab had increased margin requirements so customers have more of a cushion .

243
Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .

Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .

Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .

248
Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately , said Mr. Weiss .

249
Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion , insisting that Tandem 's new machines are n't replacements for IBM 's mainframes .

250
Do n't jump yet .

251
When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .

252
Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week .

Debt burdens are heavier .

In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % .

257
The effects were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .

258
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an outbreak of uncontrolled inflation .

259
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday .

260
A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates .

Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments , fibers and polymers .

273
When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride .

274
For weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers .

275
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .

276
We were all wonderful heroes last year , says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors .

277
At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .

278
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .

279
Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .

280
Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast .

281
People were even hoarding bags , he says .

282
No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle .

283
One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks .

284
Some say November .

285
Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives .

286
Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards .

287
When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .

288
The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .

289
These stocks eventually reopened .

Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel .

293
Meanwhile , Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43 % share it has had in recent years .

294
Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % .

295
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders .

296
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela .

Mr. Pierce said Elcotel should realize a minimum of $ 10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
