TOKENISATION PROBLEMS

* there are no quotes in CCGbank
* colons have been replaced with ::[0-9]+_ in DepBank560 (the example.trans.grtext)
  (e.g. ::13_) this is probably an artifact of lisp?

These two problems have been solved by creating example.trans.noquotes
which has the quotes filtered and the colons fixed.

The other mismatches were resolved by modifying CCGbank:

* hyphens at the beginning of sentences have been removed from DepBank560
  and sentence terminating hyphens have been changed to periods in DepBank560
* many sets of parentheses have been removed from DepBank560
* abbreviations ending sentences have an additional period, e.g.:
  Sachs & Co. -> Sachs & Co. . (Depbank560) but Sachs & Co . (CCGbank)
* some capitalisation of tokens has changed in Depbank560
* additional periods have been added to terminate sentences in Depbank560
  which don't appear in CCGbank
* decimal places ending in 0 have been changed in DepBank560 (e.g. 1.70 -> 1.7)
* PTB/CCGbank escapes slash / as \/
* -based in New York-based is a separate token in DepBank560
* some other miscellaneous tokenisation variations have been changed

* there are several sentences where whole clauses have been removed from
  DepBank560, the best example being:

CCGbank:
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB-
and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his
standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief
to other people as well as to himself .

DepBank560:
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB-
and occasionally in the middle -RRB- .

All of these changes have been made to the CCGbank tokenisation (and
in the case of removed tokens the CCGbank derivation) to match
DepBank560 (the example.trans.noquotes file). In general we have
tried not to fix any noise in the CCGbank derivations in the process.

The result is 51 sentences have been changed in some way or other.

There are three remaining sentences that don't match in tokenisation:

* one DepBank560 sentence wsj_2343.19 is missing from CCGbank:

    Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how
    because her own arrangements kept shifting .

  it has been replaced with the single token sentence:

    __PLACEHOLDER_wsj2343.19__

* two sentences in DepBank560 have words added:

the second comma after 'bad' in wsj_2381.21:

The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be
long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events ,
good or bad , , said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for
the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .

the 'it' after 'yet' in wsj_2387.16:

Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in
the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere
$ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet it has the power to run
some spreadsheets and word processing programs .

These last two are just too hard to fix without changing the derivations
too much.

The resulting depbank560.retok.auto file is the 559 CCGbank sentences
from the CCGbank1.2 AUTO files + the placeholder. The unmodified 559
sentences + placeholder are in depbank560.auto.
 
CREATING GOLD STANDARD GRs

To create the gold standard we run the parser over the *.auto files forcing
the parser to choose the gold standard derivation, and then extract the
dependencies.  23 sentences out of 560 fail to parse (coverage 95.89%)
because the gold standard derivations contain (noisy) rules not implemented
in the parser.

We then use a post processing script to improve the mapping from the
fine-grained CCGbank dependencies to Briscoe and Carroll GRs.
