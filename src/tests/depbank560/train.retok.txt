Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market .
One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name .
At 4 1/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .
Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year .
Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises .
The competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times .
Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .

When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride .
For weeks , the market had been nervous about takeovers , after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers .
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .
We were all wonderful heroes last year , says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors .
At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .
Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast .
People were even hoarding bags , he says .
No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle .

These stocks eventually reopened .
